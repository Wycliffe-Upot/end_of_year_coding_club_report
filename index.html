       <h3>END OF THE YEAR REPORT, 2023</h3>
       <P>Today marks exactly 5 months since Coding Club was incepted and listed alongside other clubs and societies in our school. The club began last term(in term two) with a total of 18 learners spread across Lower Primary and Upper primary and amazingly, the numbers doubled when we opened term three. We are currently at 40 pupils, 12 from Lower Primary and 28 from upper. </P>
       <p>Our pupils have tacitly embraced the club as they have continuously  kept asking for more coding days. They have always pestered me with their request to have another day besides Wednesdays for the club.</p>
